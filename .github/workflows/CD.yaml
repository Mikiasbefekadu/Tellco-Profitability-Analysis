name: Continuous Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger the deployment on successful push to the master branch
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering from GitHub Actions UI

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: windows-latest  # Use Windows environment for deployment job

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Python (ensure the same version as in CI pipeline)
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.x"

      # Step 3: Install dependencies from requirements.txt
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install Python dependencies

      # Step 4: Set up environment-specific configurations (e.g., credentials)
      - name: Set up environment variables
        run: |
          echo "Setting up environment variables"
          # Set any necessary environment variables like API keys or deployment configurations
          # Example: export VAR_NAME=value (You can also use GitHub Secrets here)
        shell: bash

      # Step 5: Deploy to your server or cloud service
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          # Example of deployment using FTP, cloud, or another deployment service
          echo "Deploying to production environment"
          # You can replace this with actual deployment commands
          # Example: Deploy via SSH (adjust based on your deployment process)
          # ssh user@your-server "cd /path/to/your/app && git pull && python manage.py migrate"

      # Step 6: Post-deployment validation (optional)
      - name: Post-deployment validation
        run: |
          echo "Running post-deployment checks"
          # You can run tests or checks here to ensure your deployment was successful
          # Example: curl to check app status or verify service is running
          # curl http://yourapp.com/health-check
